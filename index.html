<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What Is a Car Stereo?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A car stereo is the sound system that&apos;s installed in a car. It includes a head unit, which is the part that you see in the dashboard, and it usually has a display that shows what&apos;s playing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The head unit is connected to speakers, which are mounted in the car&apos;s interior. There is also a power amplifier, which boosts the signal from the head unit so that the speakers can produce louder sound.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And finally, there&apos;s the subwoofer. This is a special speaker that&apos;s designed to produce low-frequency sounds, and it&apos;s usually placed in the trunk of the car.</p>
